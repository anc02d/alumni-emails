# Alumni Committee Emails
This is a place to edit and collaborate on email flyers for alumni events. Submit a pull request to make changes to links, wording, images, layout, etc. 

K.I.S.S. These should be mobile-first (one column preferably) and the CSS kept simple because it must eventually become dreaded inline CSS to work with different email clients.

The flyers can be either saved to PDF for printing or put through [Mail Chimp's CSS Inliner] (https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/), then sent with whatever mail client we want to use to reach alum.
